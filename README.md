# SMRT_tuto_ECCC

Instead of figuring out how to run the notebook in this repository by yourself, you can try binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/m9brady/SMRT_tuto_ECCC/binder?labpath=SMRT_tuto_ECCC.ipynb)

*NB: the MyBinder service is free. It may be slow to launch and may experience downtime or general slowness due to varying system loads*
